<h4 style="text-indent: 10px">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)</h4>

<hr class="divider">

<button class="collapsible">What is GCMS?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>GCMS is an acronym for Global Case Management System (GCMS), an integrated system used by IRCC to process applications for Immigration and Citizenship services.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">What are GCMS Notes?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>GCMS Notes include correspondence between you and IRCC along with comments from Case Officers based on review of your application and supporting documents. These comments provide valuable information regarding current status of your application as well as reasons for your application being approved, rejected or delayed. </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Why should I order GCMS notes?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>As mentioned earlier, GCMS note allow you to find out the status of your application in addition to reasons for your application being approved, rejected or delayed. Some examples are as follows:

  <ul>You can identify errors that have been highlighted in your application by the Case Officer for additional review. Such issues can be addressed by uploading the correct information through a webform before any adverse decision is made in your case.</ul>

  <ul>You can identify supporting documents that have been parked for further review by the Case Officer for e.g. work experience letter, bank statement, gift deed etc. and address those concerns by uploading the requisite information via webform.</ul>

  <ul>You can find out reasons for your application being rejected by the Reviewing Officer. This ensures that you do not repeat the same mistakes after receiving the next Invitation to Apply (ITA). In case of error being made by the Officer in reviewing your documents, you can request to re-open your case.</ul></p>

</div>

<button class="collapsible">When should I order GCMS notes?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>GCMS Notes can be requested at any time from the date of submitting your application i.e. date of Acknowledgment of Receipt (AOR). 
You should order GCMS Notes if there has been no movement in your application for a considerable period of time i.e. three to four months after AOR date or your application has crossed the standard processing timeline.
You can also order notes after the approval of your application in case you are curious to find out how the officers assessed your credentials and other supporting documents.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">When are the GCMS notes generated after placing my order?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The GCMS notes are usually generated within a week of placing your order.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">How long does it take to receive the GCMS notes?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Under the Access to Information Act and Privacy Act, IRCC must process a request for GCMS Notes within 30 calendar days from the date of receiving it unless an extension is taken. Extension can be taken by IRCC for limited and specific reasons listed in Section 9 of the Access to Information Act and Secton 15 of the Privacy Act. We inform you right away in case of receiving notice from IRCC for such extension. Considering the large volume of requests received by IRCC, it is normal for processing time to go beyond 30 calendar days. In case of notes not being received within 40 calendar days, we submit a status request to IRCC on your behalf and promptly share their reply with you.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Will my application's processing be delayed if I order GCMS notes?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Ordering GCMS notes does not delay the processing of your application. You can order GCMS notes multiple times without any adverse impact on your application. There have been instances where ordering the GCMS notes led to movement of the application itself. Once the request for GCMS notes has been received, an officer is required to open your case file and review it before releasing the notes.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">What are CBSA notes?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>CBSA notes refer to information obtained from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to find out the status of security check or screening for your application. Since CBSA uses the same GCMS (Global Case Management System) platform like IRCC therefore GCMS notes and CBSA notes are quite similar apart from the exception that security related content is not retracted in most CBSA notes. Furthermore, CBSA notes also contain all information available with CBSA regarding your case file.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">How long does it take to receive the CBSA notes?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Unlike GCMS notes, CBSA notes are issued by CBSA in a cd through postal mail. As a result, delivery can take up to 50 calendar days after date of order, unless an extension has been taken by the CBSA.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">How secure is my personal information shared for ordering GCMS/CBSA notes?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>We ensure strict compliance with the requirements of The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) as far as handling and storage of your personal information is concerned.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Is it safe to make payment on your website?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>We are using secure payment gateways like PayPal and Stripe on our website. Furthermore, our website is secured with SSL certificate to ensure data protection.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Do you accept any other modes of payment in addition to the above?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>We accept other modes of payment including bank transfer for your convenience. In case of such requirement, you can send an email through the Contact Us section.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Will you refund me if I want to cancel my order after making the payment?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>All payments are non-refundable. We only consider making a refund in case of exceptional circumstances and evaluate each request for refund on merit. Any refund of a payment will be made after adjusting service charges levied from the concerned payment gateway. 
In order to request a refund, you can send an email to us through the Contact Us section.</p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Why if I do not receive any email after submitting the payment?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>After receiving your the payment, we will send you a confirmation email along with consent form within the next 30 minutes. In case you do not receive an email from us, please check the junk folder in your email inbox. If the email is not there, you can send us an email through the Contact Us section.</p>
</div>

  <h3>"A friend in need is a friend indeed."</h3>
  <q>I was quite terrified to see the ADR sent by SINP and contacted a famous FB consultant and paid him around SAR 1000 to avail his so called <q>Premium Service</q>. In return , got a huge amount of disappointment after seeing a <q>Generic Reply</q>. By that time, i was left with only 3 days to submit the ADR. Subsequently, got to know about GCMS GURU&#39;s <q>ADR Response Service</q> and paid a very minimal amount for it.I must give credit to Usaid who worked really very hard to bring my documents in acceptable shape till 3 AM (it was a normal working day). He was consistently on-line with me and never left me wandering alone in this journey. At last i was able to submit the ADR on time and got the nomination.</q>

  <h3>"GURUS at work."</h3>
  <q>The name GCMS GURU serves the purpose. Ever since we, as a family, decided to apply for Canadian Immigration without the help of a consultant, we were on the lookout for someone who could verify our documents before it was submitted to IRCC. A small error in any of the documents could have send our application spiraling down the rabbit hole of rejection. So, it was very vital that we selected someone or some team who understood the intricacies and nuances of each word we submitted. Glad to say we did not regret our decision to choose Usaid from GCMS GURU for this job. Every document sent by us was scrutinized and errors, however subtle, were pointed out for correction within a short time frame. When we did our final submission, we were quite confident that everything was in order and then it was smooth sailing till our PPR email came for visa issuance. Thanks to the team once again and would easily recommend them to our friends who are in the same boat. Wish you all good luck!!.</q>

  <h3>"Splendid Team with brilliant work."</h3>
  <q>The team of GCMS GURU team is very professional in their field. After receiving additional documents request from the SINP, I decided to opt for Mr. Usaid and his team professional services to fulfill the ADR. They drafted my letter of explanation and guided me so well to assure my nomination at a minimal cost. They cleared my all doubts related to documentation and address all my queries and guided for further steps. I am really thankful to them and I would highly recommend their services..</q>

  <h3>"Better than the Best!."</h3>
  <q>GCMS GURU – An apt name for Usaid and his team. We enrolled for their services right from the start and it has been one of our best decisions ever. Usaid guided us, kept motivating us, and ensured that we stayed on track and not lose our focus in each step of the PR immigration. Quite knowledgeable, prompt responses to the queries and honest opinions from him, is what kept us sane throughout this journey. The process was absolutely smooth and quicker due to thorough review of the documents and ensuring the right information was provided to the authorities. We wish the team good luck and may you scale more heights of success always.</q>

  <h3>"Exceptional services."</h3>
  <q>After receiving ITA, I had taken GCMS GURU’s services to draft my Letter of Explanation.
    Their team member Usaid helped me in this regard. I found him to be highly skilled in terms of providing real time solutions for queries related to my PR application.

    He was cooperative and always there to help me out whenever I faced any issues while submitting my application.

    GCMS GURU is very reasonable compared to other agents/consultants which is an added benefit. I would highly recommend their services to anyone who needs support in submitting their PR application for immigration.</q>

  <h3>"Very professional and experienced team."</h3>
    <q>While I was in the process of collecting my documents to submit my application, I was really confused about the Letter of explanation (LOE) and kept overthinking about other documents related to work experience and proof of funds. I desperately wanted someone to validate my documents and ensure that they are all aligned with IRCC’s requirement.
    Hence, I decided to obtain GCMS GURU’s services for a comprehensive review of my application plus drafting of the LOE. I was really impressed by their experience and knowledge about the whole Canadian immigration process as well as the way they assisted and guided me throughout the whole procedure.
    Unlike other agents or other similar service providers who charge hefty fees for their services, GCMS GURU charged me a nominal fee for the above-mentioned services.
    When I submitted my application, I was relaxed and had peace of mind since my application had was already reviewed by such dedicated professionals. Moreover, I also used their services for delivery of my PR card and Driving License from Canada to UAE.
    I would strongly recommend their services to everyone who is pursuing their dream to migrate to Canada..</q>
